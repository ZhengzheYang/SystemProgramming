Name: Zhengzhe YangCourse name: CHN 235WProfessor name: Yu LiSemester: Fall 2017Word count: New Insights Xu Bing Brought to Chinese CalligraphyXu Bing’s attempt to blur the boundary between natural and cultural language is very interesting. The definition of natural language in this reading is different from the one we have in our course. Here, natural language refers to any daily and native languages we speak, any signs we see or use, as opposed to the artificial or machine languages we invent. In his work called Tianshu, every stroke of the newly invented characters is familiar to us. We use those strokes every day to write Chinese characters. However, Xu Bing rearranged them and rendered the whole script illegible. While reading the script, Chinese speakers might feel both the sense of familiarity and frustration because this script resembles Chinese so much, but we just couldn’t understand it. “Always in sight but not quite in reach”, as I quote from the reading, the “natural” script has become a cultural invention by Xu Bing. In fact, the script doesn’t mean anything at all, and Xu Bing doesn’t want it to, which explains why we are not able to infer anything from it. Xu Bing’s work is incomprehensible and untranslatable, thus being called “Heavenly Script”. However, as other scholars pointed out, it can convey religious notions and thoughts from Taoism. Xu Bing will not stand against this opinion, of course, since this kind of openness just illustrates that “meaning is literally what the viewer makes of it”. In other words, Tianshu can mean everything because its meaning is what we get after we try so hard to comprehend it. In our mindset, things that are written down should have meant something, so people tend to intentionally make the script meaningful, even though Xu Bing might not intend to.Other calligraphic works, which in my opinion do not technically quite fit in the realm of calligraphy by Xu Bing, also brings insights to our study of calligraphy. The Helsinki-Himalaya Exchange and Reading Landscape: After Yuan Jian utilize the Chinese characters as “pictures”: Xu Bing put the Chinese character “石” on where the stone should be, and the character “木” on where the woods should be. He even added direction and position information, such as “the stone in front of the door” in Chinese. This is not so “beautiful” to me because it seems that Xu Bing just replaced some elements in the painting with the Chinese characters, which makes it look like simple descriptions of the painting, until I realized that the Chinese characters served as pictographs here because “石” and “木” look very similar to what they represent. Xu Bing even enlarged the “口” to make it more like a stone. This use of Chinese characters is so interesting that people might forget about the fact that these are just Chinese words and instead consider the painting to be complete. In another work which Xu Bing used the word “蚕” to describe the broken cocoons of silkworms because the character is a homophone to “残”. This is also the beauty of Chinese characters and calligraphy because a character somehow can directly connect to the meaning. Chinese calligraphy, as we discussed before, is not simply beautiful writing. Xu Bing’s works proved the point that Chinese calligraphers do not only pay attention to the structure and construction of their work from an aesthetic perspective. Rather, they consider what the message they try to convey and what the script semantically represents to be more important. The harmony between the calligraphy and the meaning of the characters is what most calligraphers are after. Name: Zhengzhe YangCourse name: CHN 235WProfessor name: Yu LiSemester: Fall 2017Word count: New Insights Xu Bing Brought to Chinese CalligraphyXu Bing’s attempt to blur the boundary between natural and cultural language is very interesting.

This is not so “beautiful” to me because it seems that Xu Bing just replaced some elements in the painting with the Chinese characters, which makes it look like simple descriptions of the painting, until I realized that the Chinese characters served as pictographs here because “石” and “木” look very similar to what they represent. Xu Bing even enlarged the “口” to make it more like a stone. This use of Chinese characters is so interesting that people might forget about the fact that these are just Chinese words and instead consider the painting to be complete.

The definition of natural language in this reading is different from the one we have in our course. Here, natural language refers to any daily and native languages we speak, any signs we see or use, as opposed to the artificial or machine languages we invent. In his work called Tianshu, every stroke of the newly invented characters is familiar to us. We use those strokes every day to write Chinese characters. However, Xu Bing rearranged them and rendered the whole script illegible. While reading the script, Chinese speakers might feel both the sense of familiarity and frustration because this script resembles Chinese so much, but we just couldn’t understand it. “Always in sight but not quite in reach”, as I quote from the reading, the “natural” script has become a cultural invention by Xu Bing. In fact, the script doesn’t mean anything at all, and Xu Bing doesn’t want it to, which explains why we are not able to infer anything from it. Xu Bing’s work is incomprehensible and untranslatable, thus being called “Heavenly Script”. However, as other scholars pointed out, it can convey religious notions and thoughts from Taoism. Xu Bing will not stand against this opinion, of course, since this kind of openness just illustrates that “meaning is literally what the viewer makes of it”. In other words, Tianshu can mean everything because its meaning is what we get after we try so hard to comprehend it. In our mindset, things that are written down should have meant something, so people tend to intentionally make the script meaningful, even though Xu Bing might not intend to.Other calligraphic works, which in my opinion do not technically quite fit in the realm of calligraphy by Xu Bing, also brings insights to our study of calligraphy.

The definition of natural language in this reading is different from the one we have in our course. Here, natural language refers to any daily and native languages we speak, any signs we see or use, as opposed to the artificial or machine languages we invent. In his work called Tianshu, every stroke of the newly invented characters is familiar to us. We use those strokes every day to write Chinese characters. However, Xu Bing rearranged them and rendered the whole script illegible. While reading the script, Chinese speakers might feel both the sense of familiarity and frustration because this script resembles Chinese so much, but we just couldn’t understand it. “Always in sight but not quite in reach”, as I quote from the reading, the “natural” script has become a cultural invention by Xu Bing. In fact, the script doesn’t mean anything at all, and Xu Bing doesn’t want it to, which explains why we are not able to infer anything from it. Xu Bing’s work is incomprehensible and untranslatable, thus being called “Heavenly Script”. However, as other scholars pointed out, it can convey religious notions and thoughts from Taoism. Xu Bing will not stand against this opinion, of course, since this kind of openness just illustrates that “meaning is literally what the viewer makes of it”. In other words, Tianshu can mean everything because its meaning is what we get after we try so hard to comprehend it. In our mindset, things that are written down should have meant something, so people tend to intentionally make the script meaningful, even though Xu Bing might not intend to.Other calligraphic works, which in my opinion do not technically quite fit in the realm of calligraphy by Xu Bing, also brings insights to our study of calligraphy. The Helsinki-Himalaya Exchange and Reading Landscape: After Yuan Jian utilize the Chinese characters as “pictures”: Xu Bing put the Chinese character “石” on where the stone should be, and the character “木” on where the woods should be. He even added direction and position information, such as “the stone in front of the door” in Chinese. This is not so “beautiful” to me because it seems that Xu Bing just replaced some elements in the painting with the Chinese characters, which makes it look like simple descriptions of the painting, until I realized that the Chinese characters served as pictographs here because “石” and “木” look very similar to what they represent. Xu Bing even enlarged the “口” to make it more like a stone. This use of Chinese characters is so interesting that people might forget about the fact that these are just Chinese words and instead consider the painting to be complete. In another work which Xu Bing used the word “蚕” to describe the broken cocoons of silkworms because the character is a homophone to “残”. This is also the beauty of Chinese characters and calligraphy because a character somehow can directly connect to the meaning.

In fact, the script doesn’t mean anything at all, and Xu Bing doesn’t want it to, which explains why we are not able to infer anything from it. Xu Bing’s work is incomprehensible and untranslatable, thus being called “Heavenly Script”. However, as other scholars pointed out, it can convey religious notions and thoughts from Taoism. Xu Bing will not stand against this opinion, of course, since this kind of openness just illustrates that “meaning is literally what the viewer makes of it”. In other words, Tianshu can mean everything because its meaning is what we get after we try so hard to comprehend it. In our mindset, things that are written down should have meant something, so people tend to intentionally make the script meaningful, even though Xu Bing might not intend to.Other calligraphic works, which in my opinion do not technically quite fit in the realm of calligraphy by Xu Bing, also brings insights to our study of calligraphy. The Helsinki-Himalaya Exchange and Reading Landscape: After Yuan Jian utilize the Chinese characters as “pictures”: Xu Bing put the Chinese character “石” on where the stone should be, and the character “木” on where the woods should be. He even added direction and position information, such as “the stone in front of the door” in Chinese. This is not so “beautiful” to me because it seems that Xu Bing just replaced some elements in the painting with the Chinese characters, which makes it look like simple descriptions of the painting, until I realized that the Chinese characters served as pictographs here because “石” and “木” look very similar to what they represent. Xu Bing even enlarged the “口” to make it more like a stone. This use of Chinese characters is so interesting that people might forget about the fact that these are just Chinese words and instead consider the painting to be complete. In another work which Xu Bing used the word “蚕” to describe the broken cocoons of silkworms because the character is a homophone to “残”. This is also the beauty of Chinese characters and calligraphy because a character somehow can directly connect to the meaning. Chinese calligraphy, as we discussed before, is not simply beautiful writing. Xu Bing’s works proved the point that Chinese calligraphers do not only pay attention to the structure and construction of their work from an aesthetic perspective.

This is not so “beautiful” to me because it seems that Xu Bing just replaced some elements in the painting with the Chinese characters, which makes it look like simple descriptions of the painting, until I realized that the Chinese characters served as pictographs here because “石” and “木” look very similar to what they represent.

The definition of natural language in this reading is different from the one we have in our course. Here, natural language refers to any daily and native languages we speak, any signs we see or use, as opposed to the artificial or machine languages we invent. In his work called Tianshu, every stroke of the newly invented characters is familiar to us. We use those strokes every day to write Chinese characters. However, Xu Bing rearranged them and rendered the whole script illegible. While reading the script, Chinese speakers might feel both the sense of familiarity and frustration because this script resembles Chinese so much, but we just couldn’t understand it. “Always in sight but not quite in reach”, as I quote from the reading, the “natural” script has become a cultural invention by Xu Bing. In fact, the script doesn’t mean anything at all, and Xu Bing doesn’t want it to, which explains why we are not able to infer anything from it. Xu Bing’s work is incomprehensible and untranslatable, thus being called “Heavenly Script”. However, as other scholars pointed out, it can convey religious notions and thoughts from Taoism. Xu Bing will not stand against this opinion, of course, since this kind of openness just illustrates that “meaning is literally what the viewer makes of it”.

The definition of natural language in this reading is different from the one we have in our course. Here, natural language refers to any daily and native languages we speak, any signs we see or use, as opposed to the artificial or machine languages we invent. In his work called Tianshu, every stroke of the newly invented characters is familiar to us. We use those strokes every day to write Chinese characters. However, Xu Bing rearranged them and rendered the whole script illegible. While reading the script, Chinese speakers might feel both the sense of familiarity and frustration because this script resembles Chinese so much, but we just couldn’t understand it. “Always in sight but not quite in reach”, as I quote from the reading, the “natural” script has become a cultural invention by Xu Bing. In fact, the script doesn’t mean anything at all, and Xu Bing doesn’t want it to, which explains why we are not able to infer anything from it. Xu Bing’s work is incomprehensible and untranslatable, thus being called “Heavenly Script”. However, as other scholars pointed out, it can convey religious notions and thoughts from Taoism. Xu Bing will not stand against this opinion, of course, since this kind of openness just illustrates that “meaning is literally what the viewer makes of it”. In other words, Tianshu can mean everything because its meaning is what we get after we try so hard to comprehend it. In our mindset, things that are written down should have meant something, so people tend to intentionally make the script meaningful, even though Xu Bing might not intend to.Other calligraphic works, which in my opinion do not technically quite fit in the realm of calligraphy by Xu Bing, also brings insights to our study of calligraphy. The Helsinki-Himalaya Exchange and Reading Landscape: After Yuan Jian utilize the Chinese characters as “pictures”: Xu Bing put the Chinese character “石” on where the stone should be, and the character “木” on where the woods should be. He even added direction and position information, such as “the stone in front of the door” in Chinese. This is not so “beautiful” to me because it seems that Xu Bing just replaced some elements in the painting with the Chinese characters, which makes it look like simple descriptions of the painting, until I realized that the Chinese characters served as pictographs here because “石” and “木” look very similar to what they represent. Xu Bing even enlarged the “口” to make it more like a stone.

In his work called Tianshu, every stroke of the newly invented characters is familiar to us. We use those strokes every day to write Chinese characters. However, Xu Bing rearranged them and rendered the whole script illegible. While reading the script, Chinese speakers might feel both the sense of familiarity and frustration because this script resembles Chinese so much, but we just couldn’t understand it. “Always in sight but not quite in reach”, as I quote from the reading, the “natural” script has become a cultural invention by Xu Bing. In fact, the script doesn’t mean anything at all, and Xu Bing doesn’t want it to, which explains why we are not able to infer anything from it. Xu Bing’s work is incomprehensible and untranslatable, thus being called “Heavenly Script”. However, as other scholars pointed out, it can convey religious notions and thoughts from Taoism. Xu Bing will not stand against this opinion, of course, since this kind of openness just illustrates that “meaning is literally what the viewer makes of it”. In other words, Tianshu can mean everything because its meaning is what we get after we try so hard to comprehend it. In our mindset, things that are written down should have meant something, so people tend to intentionally make the script meaningful, even though Xu Bing might not intend to.Other calligraphic works, which in my opinion do not technically quite fit in the realm of calligraphy by Xu Bing, also brings insights to our study of calligraphy. The Helsinki-Himalaya Exchange and Reading Landscape: After Yuan Jian utilize the Chinese characters as “pictures”: Xu Bing put the Chinese character “石” on where the stone should be, and the character “木” on where the woods should be. He even added direction and position information, such as “the stone in front of the door” in Chinese. This is not so “beautiful” to me because it seems that Xu Bing just replaced some elements in the painting with the Chinese characters, which makes it look like simple descriptions of the painting, until I realized that the Chinese characters served as pictographs here because “石” and “木” look very similar to what they represent. Xu Bing even enlarged the “口” to make it more like a stone. This use of Chinese characters is so interesting that people might forget about the fact that these are just Chinese words and instead consider the painting to be complete. In another work which Xu Bing used the word “蚕” to describe the broken cocoons of silkworms because the character is a homophone to “残”. This is also the beauty of Chinese characters and calligraphy because a character somehow can directly connect to the meaning. Chinese calligraphy, as we discussed before, is not simply beautiful writing. Xu Bing’s works proved the point that Chinese calligraphers do not only pay attention to the structure and construction of their work from an aesthetic perspective. Rather, they consider what the message they try to convey and what the script semantically represents to be more important. The harmony between the calligraphy and the meaning of the characters is what most calligraphers are after. Name: Zhengzhe YangCourse name: CHN 235WProfessor name: Yu LiSemester: Fall 2017Word count: New Insights Xu Bing Brought to Chinese CalligraphyXu Bing’s attempt to blur the boundary between natural and cultural language is very interesting.

The Helsinki-Himalaya Exchange and Reading Landscape: After Yuan Jian utilize the Chinese characters as “pictures”: Xu Bing put the Chinese character “石” on where the stone should be, and the character “木” on where the woods should be. He even added direction and position information, such as “the stone in front of the door” in Chinese. This is not so “beautiful” to me because it seems that Xu Bing just replaced some elements in the painting with the Chinese characters, which makes it look like simple descriptions of the painting, until I realized that the Chinese characters served as pictographs here because “石” and “木” look very similar to what they represent. Xu Bing even enlarged the “口” to make it more like a stone. This use of Chinese characters is so interesting that people might forget about the fact that these are just Chinese words and instead consider the painting to be complete. In another work which Xu Bing used the word “蚕” to describe the broken cocoons of silkworms because the character is a homophone to “残”. This is also the beauty of Chinese characters and calligraphy because a character somehow can directly connect to the meaning.

The definition of natural language in this reading is different from the one we have in our course. Here, natural language refers to any daily and native languages we speak, any signs we see or use, as opposed to the artificial or machine languages we invent.

However, Xu Bing rearranged them and rendered the whole script illegible. While reading the script, Chinese speakers might feel both the sense of familiarity and frustration because this script resembles Chinese so much, but we just couldn’t understand it. “Always in sight but not quite in reach”, as I quote from the reading, the “natural” script has become a cultural invention by Xu Bing. In fact, the script doesn’t mean anything at all, and Xu Bing doesn’t want it to, which explains why we are not able to infer anything from it. Xu Bing’s work is incomprehensible and untranslatable, thus being called “Heavenly Script”. However, as other scholars pointed out, it can convey religious notions and thoughts from Taoism.

The definition of natural language in this reading is different from the one we have in our course. Here, natural language refers to any daily and native languages we speak, any signs we see or use, as opposed to the artificial or machine languages we invent. In his work called Tianshu, every stroke of the newly invented characters is familiar to us. We use those strokes every day to write Chinese characters. However, Xu Bing rearranged them and rendered the whole script illegible. While reading the script, Chinese speakers might feel both the sense of familiarity and frustration because this script resembles Chinese so much, but we just couldn’t understand it. “Always in sight but not quite in reach”, as I quote from the reading, the “natural” script has become a cultural invention by Xu Bing. In fact, the script doesn’t mean anything at all, and Xu Bing doesn’t want it to, which explains why we are not able to infer anything from it. Xu Bing’s work is incomprehensible and untranslatable, thus being called “Heavenly Script”. However, as other scholars pointed out, it can convey religious notions and thoughts from Taoism. Xu Bing will not stand against this opinion, of course, since this kind of openness just illustrates that “meaning is literally what the viewer makes of it”. In other words, Tianshu can mean everything because its meaning is what we get after we try so hard to comprehend it. In our mindset, things that are written down should have meant something, so people tend to intentionally make the script meaningful, even though Xu Bing might not intend to.Other calligraphic works, which in my opinion do not technically quite fit in the realm of calligraphy by Xu Bing, also brings insights to our study of calligraphy. The Helsinki-Himalaya Exchange and Reading Landscape: After Yuan Jian utilize the Chinese characters as “pictures”: Xu Bing put the Chinese character “石” on where the stone should be, and the character “木” on where the woods should be. He even added direction and position information, such as “the stone in front of the door” in Chinese. This is not so “beautiful” to me because it seems that Xu Bing just replaced some elements in the painting with the Chinese characters, which makes it look like simple descriptions of the painting, until I realized that the Chinese characters served as pictographs here because “石” and “木” look very similar to what they represent.

In his work called Tianshu, every stroke of the newly invented characters is familiar to us. We use those strokes every day to write Chinese characters. However, Xu Bing rearranged them and rendered the whole script illegible. While reading the script, Chinese speakers might feel both the sense of familiarity and frustration because this script resembles Chinese so much, but we just couldn’t understand it. “Always in sight but not quite in reach”, as I quote from the reading, the “natural” script has become a cultural invention by Xu Bing. In fact, the script doesn’t mean anything at all, and Xu Bing doesn’t want it to, which explains why we are not able to infer anything from it. Xu Bing’s work is incomprehensible and untranslatable, thus being called “Heavenly Script”. However, as other scholars pointed out, it can convey religious notions and thoughts from Taoism. Xu Bing will not stand against this opinion, of course, since this kind of openness just illustrates that “meaning is literally what the viewer makes of it”. In other words, Tianshu can mean everything because its meaning is what we get after we try so hard to comprehend it. In our mindset, things that are written down should have meant something, so people tend to intentionally make the script meaningful, even though Xu Bing might not intend to.Other calligraphic works, which in my opinion do not technically quite fit in the realm of calligraphy by Xu Bing, also brings insights to our study of calligraphy. The Helsinki-Himalaya Exchange and Reading Landscape: After Yuan Jian utilize the Chinese characters as “pictures”: Xu Bing put the Chinese character “石” on where the stone should be, and the character “木” on where the woods should be. He even added direction and position information, such as “the stone in front of the door” in Chinese. This is not so “beautiful” to me because it seems that Xu Bing just replaced some elements in the painting with the Chinese characters, which makes it look like simple descriptions of the painting, until I realized that the Chinese characters served as pictographs here because “石” and “木” look very similar to what they represent. Xu Bing even enlarged the “口” to make it more like a stone. This use of Chinese characters is so interesting that people might forget about the fact that these are just Chinese words and instead consider the painting to be complete. In another work which Xu Bing used the word “蚕” to describe the broken cocoons of silkworms because the character is a homophone to “残”. This is also the beauty of Chinese characters and calligraphy because a character somehow can directly connect to the meaning. Chinese calligraphy, as we discussed before, is not simply beautiful writing. Xu Bing’s works proved the point that Chinese calligraphers do not only pay attention to the structure and construction of their work from an aesthetic perspective. Rather, they consider what the message they try to convey and what the script semantically represents to be more important. The harmony between the calligraphy and the meaning of the characters is what most calligraphers are after. Name: Zhengzhe YangCourse name: CHN 235WProfessor name: Yu LiSemester: Fall 2017Word count: New Insights Xu Bing Brought to Chinese CalligraphyXu Bing’s attempt to blur the boundary between natural and cultural language is very interesting.

The Helsinki-Himalaya Exchange and Reading Landscape: After Yuan Jian utilize the Chinese characters as “pictures”: Xu Bing put the Chinese character “石” on where the stone should be, and the character “木” on where the woods should be. He even added direction and position information, such as “the stone in front of the door” in Chinese. This is not so “beautiful” to me because it seems that Xu Bing just replaced some elements in the painting with the Chinese characters, which makes it look like simple descriptions of the painting, until I realized that the Chinese characters served as pictographs here because “石” and “木” look very similar to what they represent. Xu Bing even enlarged the “口” to make it more like a stone. This use of Chinese characters is so interesting that people might forget about the fact that these are just Chinese words and instead consider the painting to be complete. In another work which Xu Bing used the word “蚕” to describe the broken cocoons of silkworms because the character is a homophone to “残”. This is also the beauty of Chinese characters and calligraphy because a character somehow can directly connect to the meaning.

The definition of natural language in this reading is different from the one we have in our course. Here, natural language refers to any daily and native languages we speak, any signs we see or use, as opposed to the artificial or machine languages we invent.

However, Xu Bing rearranged them and rendered the whole script illegible. While reading the script, Chinese speakers might feel both the sense of familiarity and frustration because this script resembles Chinese so much, but we just couldn’t understand it. “Always in sight but not quite in reach”, as I quote from the reading, the “natural” script has become a cultural invention by Xu Bing. In fact, the script doesn’t mean anything at all, and Xu Bing doesn’t want it to, which explains why we are not able to infer anything from it. Xu Bing’s work is incomprehensible and untranslatable, thus being called “Heavenly Script”. However, as other scholars pointed out, it can convey religious notions and thoughts from Taoism.

The definition of natural language in this reading is different from the one we have in our course. Here, natural language refers to any daily and native languages we speak, any signs we see or use, as opposed to the artificial or machine languages we invent. In his work called Tianshu, every stroke of the newly invented characters is familiar to us. We use those strokes every day to write Chinese characters. However, Xu Bing rearranged them and rendered the whole script illegible. While reading the script, Chinese speakers might feel both the sense of familiarity and frustration because this script resembles Chinese so much, but we just couldn’t understand it. “Always in sight but not quite in reach”, as I quote from the reading, the “natural” script has become a cultural invention by Xu Bing. In fact, the script doesn’t mean anything at all, and Xu Bing doesn’t want it to, which explains why we are not able to infer anything from it. Xu Bing’s work is incomprehensible and untranslatable, thus being called “Heavenly Script”. However, as other scholars pointed out, it can convey religious notions and thoughts from Taoism. Xu Bing will not stand against this opinion, of course, since this kind of openness just illustrates that “meaning is literally what the viewer makes of it”. In other words, Tianshu can mean everything because its meaning is what we get after we try so hard to comprehend it. In our mindset, things that are written down should have meant something, so people tend to intentionally make the script meaningful, even though Xu Bing might not intend to.Other calligraphic works, which in my opinion do not technically quite fit in the realm of calligraphy by Xu Bing, also brings insights to our study of calligraphy. The Helsinki-Himalaya Exchange and Reading Landscape: After Yuan Jian utilize the Chinese characters as “pictures”: Xu Bing put the Chinese character “石” on where the stone should be, and the character “木” on where the woods should be. He even added direction and position information, such as “the stone in front of the door” in Chinese. This is not so “beautiful” to me because it seems that Xu Bing just replaced some elements in the painting with the Chinese characters, which makes it look like simple descriptions of the painting, until I realized that the Chinese characters served as pictographs here because “石” and “木” look very similar to what they represent.

In his work called Tianshu, every stroke of the newly invented characters is familiar to us. We use those strokes every day to write Chinese characters. However, Xu Bing rearranged them and rendered the whole script illegible. While reading the script, Chinese speakers might feel both the sense of familiarity and frustration because this script resembles Chinese so much, but we just couldn’t understand it. “Always in sight but not quite in reach”, as I quote from the reading, the “natural” script has become a cultural invention by Xu Bing. In fact, the script doesn’t mean anything at all, and Xu Bing doesn’t want it to, which explains why we are not able to infer anything from it. Xu Bing’s work is incomprehensible and untranslatable, thus being called “Heavenly Script”. However, as other scholars pointed out, it can convey religious notions and thoughts from Taoism. Xu Bing will not stand against this opinion, of course, since this kind of openness just illustrates that “meaning is literally what the viewer makes of it”. In other words, Tianshu can mean everything because its meaning is what we get after we try so hard to comprehend it. In our mindset, things that are written down should have meant something, so people tend to intentionally make the script meaningful, even though Xu Bing might not intend to.Other calligraphic works, which in my opinion do not technically quite fit in the realm of calligraphy by Xu Bing, also brings insights to our study of calligraphy. The Helsinki-Himalaya Exchange and Reading Landscape: After Yuan Jian utilize the Chinese characters as “pictures”: Xu Bing put the Chinese character “石” on where the stone should be, and the character “木” on where the woods should be. He even added direction and position information, such as “the stone in front of the door” in Chinese. This is not so “beautiful” to me because it seems that Xu Bing just replaced some elements in the painting with the Chinese characters, which makes it look like simple descriptions of the painting, until I realized that the Chinese characters served as pictographs here because “石” and “木” look very similar to what they represent. Xu Bing even enlarged the “口” to make it more like a stone. This use of Chinese characters is so interesting that people might forget about the fact that these are just Chinese words and instead consider the painting to be complete. In another work which Xu Bing used the word “蚕” to describe the broken cocoons of silkworms because the character is a homophone to “残”. This is also the beauty of Chinese characters and calligraphy because a character somehow can directly connect to the meaning. Chinese calligraphy, as we discussed before, is not simply beautiful writing. Xu Bing’s works proved the point that Chinese calligraphers do not only pay attention to the structure and construction of their work from an aesthetic perspective. Rather, they consider what the message they try to convey and what the script semantically represents to be more important. The harmony between the calligraphy and the meaning of the characters is what most calligraphers are after. Name: Zhengzhe YangCourse name: CHN 235WProfessor name: Yu LiSemester: Fall 2017Word count: New Insights Xu Bing Brought to Chinese CalligraphyXu Bing’s attempt to blur the boundary between natural and cultural language is very interesting.

The Helsinki-Himalaya Exchange and Reading Landscape: After Yuan Jian utilize the Chinese characters as “pictures”: Xu Bing put the Chinese character “石” on where the stone should be, and the character “木” on where the woods should be. He even added direction and position information, such as “the stone in front of the door” in Chinese. This is not so “beautiful” to me because it seems that Xu Bing just replaced some elements in the painting with the Chinese characters, which makes it look like simple descriptions of the painting, until I realized that the Chinese characters served as pictographs here because “石” and “木” look very similar to what they represent. Xu Bing even enlarged the “口” to make it more like a stone. This use of Chinese characters is so interesting that people might forget about the fact that these are just Chinese words and instead consider the painting to be complete. In another work which Xu Bing used the word “蚕” to describe the broken cocoons of silkworms because the character is a homophone to “残”. This is also the beauty of Chinese characters and calligraphy because a character somehow can directly connect to the meaning.

The definition of natural language in this reading is different from the one we have in our course. Here, natural language refers to any daily and native languages we speak, any signs we see or use, as opposed to the artificial or machine languages we invent.

However, Xu Bing rearranged them and rendered the whole script illegible. While reading the script, Chinese speakers might feel both the sense of familiarity and frustration because this script resembles Chinese so much, but we just couldn’t understand it. “Always in sight but not quite in reach”, as I quote from the reading, the “natural” script has become a cultural invention by Xu Bing. In fact, the script doesn’t mean anything at all, and Xu Bing doesn’t want it to, which explains why we are not able to infer anything from it. Xu Bing’s work is incomprehensible and untranslatable, thus being called “Heavenly Script”. However, as other scholars pointed out, it can convey religious notions and thoughts from Taoism.

The definition of natural language in this reading is different from the one we have in our course. Here, natural language refers to any daily and native languages we speak, any signs we see or use, as opposed to the artificial or machine languages we invent. In his work called Tianshu, every stroke of the newly invented characters is familiar to us. We use those strokes every day to write Chinese characters. However, Xu Bing rearranged them and rendered the whole script illegible. While reading the script, Chinese speakers might feel both the sense of familiarity and frustration because this script resembles Chinese so much, but we just couldn’t understand it. “Always in sight but not quite in reach”, as I quote from the reading, the “natural” script has become a cultural invention by Xu Bing. In fact, the script doesn’t mean anything at all, and Xu Bing doesn’t want it to, which explains why we are not able to infer anything from it. Xu Bing’s work is incomprehensible and untranslatable, thus being called “Heavenly Script”. However, as other scholars pointed out, it can convey religious notions and thoughts from Taoism. Xu Bing will not stand against this opinion, of course, since this kind of openness just illustrates that “meaning is literally what the viewer makes of it”. In other words, Tianshu can mean everything because its meaning is what we get after we try so hard to comprehend it. In our mindset, things that are written down should have meant something, so people tend to intentionally make the script meaningful, even though Xu Bing might not intend to.Other calligraphic works, which in my opinion do not technically quite fit in the realm of calligraphy by Xu Bing, also brings insights to our study of calligraphy. The Helsinki-Himalaya Exchange and Reading Landscape: After Yuan Jian utilize the Chinese characters as “pictures”: Xu Bing put the Chinese character “石” on where the stone should be, and the character “木” on where the woods should be. He even added direction and position information, such as “the stone in front of the door” in Chinese. This is not so “beautiful” to me because it seems that Xu Bing just replaced some elements in the painting with the Chinese characters, which makes it look like simple descriptions of the painting, until I realized that the Chinese characters served as pictographs here because “石” and “木” look very similar to what they represent.

In his work called Tianshu, every stroke of the newly invented characters is familiar to us. We use those strokes every day to write Chinese characters. However, Xu Bing rearranged them and rendered the whole script illegible. While reading the script, Chinese speakers might feel both the sense of familiarity and frustration because this script resembles Chinese so much, but we just couldn’t understand it. “Always in sight but not quite in reach”, as I quote from the reading, the “natural” script has become a cultural invention by Xu Bing. In fact, the script doesn’t mean anything at all, and Xu Bing doesn’t want it to, which explains why we are not able to infer anything from it. Xu Bing’s work is incomprehensible and untranslatable, thus being called “Heavenly Script”. However, as other scholars pointed out, it can convey religious notions and thoughts from Taoism. Xu Bing will not stand against this opinion, of course, since this kind of openness just illustrates that “meaning is literally what the viewer makes of it”. In other words, Tianshu can mean everything because its meaning is what we get after we try so hard to comprehend it. In our mindset, things that are written down should have meant something, so people tend to intentionally make the script meaningful, even though Xu Bing might not intend to.Other calligraphic works, which in my opinion do not technically quite fit in the realm of calligraphy by Xu Bing, also brings insights to our study of calligraphy. The Helsinki-Himalaya Exchange and Reading Landscape: After Yuan Jian utilize the Chinese characters as “pictures”: Xu Bing put the Chinese character “石” on where the stone should be, and the character “木” on where the woods should be. He even added direction and position information, such as “the stone in front of the door” in Chinese. This is not so “beautiful” to me because it seems that Xu Bing just replaced some elements in the painting with the Chinese characters, which makes it look like simple descriptions of the painting, until I realized that the Chinese characters served as pictographs here because “石” and “木” look very similar to what they represent. Xu Bing even enlarged the “口” to make it more like a stone. This use of Chinese characters is so interesting that people might forget about the fact that these are just Chinese words and instead consider the painting to be complete. In another work which Xu Bing used the word “蚕” to describe the broken cocoons of silkworms because the character is a homophone to “残”. This is also the beauty of Chinese characters and calligraphy because a character somehow can directly connect to the meaning. Chinese calligraphy, as we discussed before, is not simply beautiful writing. Xu Bing’s works proved the point that Chinese calligraphers do not only pay attention to the structure and construction of their work from an aesthetic perspective. Rather, they consider what the message they try to convey and what the script semantically represents to be more important. The harmony between the calligraphy and the meaning of the characters is what most calligraphers are after. Name: Zhengzhe YangCourse name: CHN 235WProfessor name: Yu LiSemester: Fall 2017Word count: New Insights Xu Bing Brought to Chinese CalligraphyXu Bing’s attempt to blur the boundary between natural and cultural language is very interesting.

The Helsinki-Himalaya Exchange and Reading Landscape: After Yuan Jian utilize the Chinese characters as “pictures”: Xu Bing put the Chinese character “石” on where the stone should be, and the character “木” on where the woods should be. He even added direction and position information, such as “the stone in front of the door” in Chinese. This is not so “beautiful” to me because it seems that Xu Bing just replaced some elements in the painting with the Chinese characters, which makes it look like simple descriptions of the painting, until I realized that the Chinese characters served as pictographs here because “石” and “木” look very similar to what they represent. Xu Bing even enlarged the “口” to make it more like a stone. This use of Chinese characters is so interesting that people might forget about the fact that these are just Chinese words and instead consider the painting to be complete. In another work which Xu Bing used the word “蚕” to describe the broken cocoons of silkworms because the character is a homophone to “残”. This is also the beauty of Chinese characters and calligraphy because a character somehow can directly connect to the meaning.

The definition of natural language in this reading is different from the one we have in our course. Here, natural language refers to any daily and native languages we speak, any signs we see or use, as opposed to the artificial or machine languages we invent.

However, Xu Bing rearranged them and rendered the whole script illegible. While reading the script, Chinese speakers might feel both the sense of familiarity and frustration because this script resembles Chinese so much, but we just couldn’t understand it. “Always in sight but not quite in reach”, as I quote from the reading, the “natural” script has become a cultural invention by Xu Bing. In fact, the script doesn’t mean anything at all, and Xu Bing doesn’t want it to, which explains why we are not able to infer anything from it. Xu Bing’s work is incomprehensible and untranslatable, thus being called “Heavenly Script”. However, as other scholars pointed out, it can convey religious notions and thoughts from Taoism.

The definition of natural language in this reading is different from the one we have in our course. Here, natural language refers to any daily and native languages we speak, any signs we see or use, as opposed to the artificial or machine languages we invent. In his work called Tianshu, every stroke of the newly invented characters is familiar to us. We use those strokes every day to write Chinese characters. However, Xu Bing rearranged them and rendered the whole script illegible. While reading the script, Chinese speakers might feel both the sense of familiarity and frustration because this script resembles Chinese so much, but we just couldn’t understand it. “Always in sight but not quite in reach”, as I quote from the reading, the “natural” script has become a cultural invention by Xu Bing. In fact, the script doesn’t mean anything at all, and Xu Bing doesn’t want it to, which explains why we are not able to infer anything from it. Xu Bing’s work is incomprehensible and untranslatable, thus being called “Heavenly Script”. However, as other scholars pointed out, it can convey religious notions and thoughts from Taoism. Xu Bing will not stand against this opinion, of course, since this kind of openness just illustrates that “meaning is literally what the viewer makes of it”. In other words, Tianshu can mean everything because its meaning is what we get after we try so hard to comprehend it. In our mindset, things that are written down should have meant something, so people tend to intentionally make the script meaningful, even though Xu Bing might not intend to.Other calligraphic works, which in my opinion do not technically quite fit in the realm of calligraphy by Xu Bing, also brings insights to our study of calligraphy. The Helsinki-Himalaya Exchange and Reading Landscape: After Yuan Jian utilize the Chinese characters as “pictures”: Xu Bing put the Chinese character “石” on where the stone should be, and the character “木” on where the woods should be. He even added direction and position information, such as “the stone in front of the door” in Chinese. This is not so “beautiful” to me because it seems that Xu Bing just replaced some elements in the painting with the Chinese characters, which makes it look like simple descriptions of the painting, until I realized that the Chinese characters served as pictographs here because “石” and “木” look very similar to what they represent.

In his work called Tianshu, every stroke of the newly invented characters is familiar to us. We use those strokes every day to write Chinese characters. However, Xu Bing rearranged them and rendered the whole script illegible. While reading the script, Chinese speakers might feel both the sense of familiarity and frustration because this script resembles Chinese so much, but we just couldn’t understand it. “Always in sight but not quite in reach”, as I quote from the reading, the “natural” script has become a cultural invention by Xu Bing. In fact, the script doesn’t mean anything at all, and Xu Bing doesn’t want it to, which explains why we are not able to infer anything from it. Xu Bing’s work is incomprehensible and untranslatable, thus being called “Heavenly Script”. However, as other scholars pointed out, it can convey religious notions and thoughts from Taoism. Xu Bing will not stand against this opinion, of course, since this kind of openness just illustrates that “meaning is literally what the viewer makes of it”. In other words, Tianshu can mean everything because its meaning is what we get after we try so hard to comprehend it. In our mindset, things that are written down should have meant something, so people tend to intentionally make the script meaningful, even though Xu Bing might not intend to.Other calligraphic works, which in my opinion do not technically quite fit in the realm of calligraphy by Xu Bing, also brings insights to our study of calligraphy. The Helsinki-Himalaya Exchange and Reading Landscape: After Yuan Jian utilize the Chinese characters as “pictures”: Xu Bing put the Chinese character “石” on where the stone should be, and the character “木” on where the woods should be. He even added direction and position information, such as “the stone in front of the door” in Chinese. This is not so “beautiful” to me because it seems that Xu Bing just replaced some elements in the painting with the Chinese characters, which makes it look like simple descriptions of the painting, until I realized that the Chinese characters served as pictographs here because “石” and “木” look very similar to what they represent. Xu Bing even enlarged the “口” to make it more like a stone. This use of Chinese characters is so interesting that people might forget about the fact that these are just Chinese words and instead consider the painting to be complete. In another work which Xu Bing used the word “蚕” to describe the broken cocoons of silkworms because the character is a homophone to “残”. This is also the beauty of Chinese characters and calligraphy because a character somehow can directly connect to the meaning. Chinese calligraphy, as we discussed before, is not simply beautiful writing. Xu Bing’s works proved the point that Chinese calligraphers do not only pay attention to the structure and construction of their work from an aesthetic perspective. Rather, they consider what the message they try to convey and what the script semantically represents to be more important. The harmony between the calligraphy and the meaning of the characters is what most calligraphers are after.
